PowerPoint Assignment for Fall2021 ICA Class

This repo will have presentations from the students describing themselves. 

While I have briefly discussed about this during the class, however, consider visiting this resource for more details on the topic. (https://www.presentationmagazine.com/how-to-do-a-presentation-about-yourself-3165.htm)

Please remember that this is a public repository and your work will reamain showcased so do NOT put any contact details or personal information in the presentation other than your name. If you feel OK you can present your picture, since they are already part of public record in one or the otherway.

I would strongly suggest that you to put a slide or two reflecting on the course... especially if you think you have learned a thing or two in the course.

Cheers!
